This project is a lightweight file encryption tool written in C++ that demonstrates how file content can be modified, scrambled and restored using a reversible custom logic.
It works by reading target files in binary format, injecting randomized encoded patterns, reversing data segments, and rewriting the scrambled data back into the original file.
