                                                    #🖨️ C++ Virtual Typewriter Automation

This project is a Windows-based automated typing system built in C++.
It simulates human-like typing by moving the mouse cursor to a specific position and generating real keystrokes — similar to tools like AutoHotKey or PyAutoGUI, but fully implemented using the Win32 API.
